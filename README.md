## Description

Genshin Planner is MVP based on other genshin planners. Its function is to calculate how many materials do you need to level up a character in the game to a certain level. This can be useful if you are playing Genshin Impact and want to plan for the materials to level up certain characters.

### Features:

* You can add the character you are planning to level up.

* You can remove that character from the planner.

* You can see the materials needed to level up a character based on the materials you have in your inventory.

* You can manage your inventory.

* If you manage your inventory, like adding or removing materials, the change will be reflected in your characters.
